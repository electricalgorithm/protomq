# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

As of now, the project is still not in production-grade. Please use it at your own risk. It's only one person who tries to maintain it; therefore, no security policy is promised.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please create an issue on GitHub if it's not high risk in your opinion. For anything serious, contact the maintainer via appsec@gyokhan.com.
